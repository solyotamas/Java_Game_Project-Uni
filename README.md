# Safari Tycoon

**Safari Tycoon** is a simulation game developed as a university group project, as part of a software development course.
Players take on the role of safari park managers, building the environment, caring for animals, and managing visitors.

Originally developed using GitLab, the project is written fully in **Java** and uses **JavaFX** for the graphical user interface.
The wiki for the game is written mostly in hungarian, which also serves as a better introduction to the game than this readme.
